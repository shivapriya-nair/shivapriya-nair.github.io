Hello! 

My name is Shivapriya Nair and I'm an international student from Lesotho and India.  

I am currently a Senior Environmental Studies - Geography Joint Major and Global Health Minor at Middlebury College. This semester, I am excited to participate in  Open Source GIS - a class designed to develop critical analytical skills, familiarity with open source software and higher competency in conducting reliable research. This website acts as a store for my reflections and reports as the class progresses.

Through advancing my own scientific literacy and ability to reproduce and replicate published research, I plan to grow my confidence in obtaining and analysing geographic data and designing reliable studies. I hope to apply these skills to work related to promoting environmental justice and public health.
